[**#Weights**](https://designsystem.morningstar.com/brand/guidelines/visual/typography/?tab=basic#weights)  
> Univers Next for Morningstar comes in many weights, but in most instances, we use **`Condensed Light`**. Using a single weight helps the user focus on the content, not the typography.
> 
> Use **`Condensed Bold`** to bring clarity or hierarchy to text, but do so sparingly. Condensed Bold is typically used for eyebrows and small headings. For more guidance on choosing the right weight, see Emphasis and Hierarchy.
